Hello!

This is my portfolio containing several projects I've done and am currently working on relating to music, technology and engineering, or both. I have 4 main projects in here: Music Compositions & Sheet Music, Audio Analysis MATLAB code, Pitch Detection and Harmonization MATLAB code (PitchChord), and the LED Foul Indicator project [ongoing]

All folders contain the necessary files and README descriptions for viewing and/or listening.
