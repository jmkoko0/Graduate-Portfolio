These are two compositions that I've made within the past year.

VILLANOVA SHORTS:
This is something I made for the Villanova Band, Cheer, and Dance Teams after being approached by Villanova Athletics in pursuit of new chants and cheers. There are 3 shorts: First Down, NO-VA, and March On. The First Down short is self-explanatory, being played after the football team gets a first down. It is a play on our fight song and ends with a VI-VII-I (VIII) progression which is common in pep/marching band fanfares. NO-VA is a fan favorite, having a melody repeated in chromatic ascending order (Ab-A-Bb) with easy lyrics for fans to cheer along with. March On is another short that involves a chant after a trumpet fanfare with the rest of the band providing supporting chords. All three shorts have been integrated into the gameday repertoire.

ASCENSION:
This is a composition I made for my Music Theory class that displays both my expertise with music and creativity. Though not an long piece, there are a lot of elements that highlight all sections of the ensemble including a brass fanfare, clarinet trio, and percussion grooves that drive the song forward. 

Audio files for both pieces are included, though keep in mind these were written on MuseScore and thus the audio is at the mercy of the software. 
Enjoy :)
